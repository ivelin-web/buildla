# üé® How to Customize Your Chat Widget

## üìÅ Important: Two Files to Edit

**Always edit BOTH files when making changes:**
- **For testing**: `public/chat-widget.html` 
- **For your website**: `squarespace-embed-code.html`

## üîß Quick Changes

### Change Header Text
Find: `<p>Testing the Swedish bathroom renovation assistant</p>`  
Change to: Whatever you want

### Change Welcome Message  
Find: `Testing started! The AI will respond in Swedish...`  
Change to: Your message

### Change Placeholder Text
Find: `placeholder="Type your message (will respond in Swedish)..."`  
Change to: Your placeholder

### Change Main Colors
Find: `#667eea` and `#764ba2`  
Change to: Your color codes ([get colors here](https://htmlcolorcodes.com/))

### Change Button Color

Change to: Your button color

## Add New Chat Services/Tasks

### Step 1: Add New Task
**File to edit**: `api/tasks.js`
**What to find**: The tasks array
**Add your new task** like this:
```javascript
{
    id: 'new-service',
    name: 'Your New Service',
    description: 'What this service does',
    systemPrompt: 'You are a helpful assistant for...'
}
```

### Step 2: Update the AI Instructions
In the `systemPrompt`, write clear instructions for how the AI should behave for this new service.

**Example**:
```javascript
systemPrompt: 'You are a helpful assistant for kitchen renovations. Always respond in Swedish. Help users plan their kitchen renovation, suggest materials, and provide cost estimates.'
```
